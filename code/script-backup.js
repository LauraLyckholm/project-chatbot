// This function will add a chat bubble in the correct place based on who the sender is
const showMessage = (message, sender) => {
    // the if statement checks if the sender is 'user' and if that's the case it inserts an html senction inside the chat with the posted message

      <section class="user-msg">

COMMENT TO README INCASE I USE THIS
I was trying to reach the text the user had typed into the input, but found that very tricky. I tried making the variable that stored the value global, but it still wouldn't log it on testing. The problem was that the answer was logged within a function, and making the variable global didn't work because Javascript loads asynchronously = the submitForm function had not finished executing when I tried to access it. 

After a lot of trial and error I found a way to do this using a callback function. The callback function is created higher up, and then added as a parameter in the submitForm function. After updating the userAnswer, the callback is invoked with the updated answer as an argument. This ensures that the handleUserAnswer function is called at the right time, after the userAnswer has been updated.*/
